Currently, this is setup to view the Pool Tournament Scheduler project I've been using to teach myself VueJS & Vuex.

Working towards final finctionality: make matches, make dates, slot teams and dates into matches and the schedule should just show up.
Then, do styling to schedule so that it looks good no matter what.
Finally, persist the "locations" object into localStorage.
